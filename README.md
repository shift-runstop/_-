## $F(Ï‰)$

Precise frequency analysis and manipulation of grains
Easy implementation of pitch-shifting and time-stretching
Spectral processing techniques like cross-synthesis between grains
continuous Fourier transform $F(Ï‰)$ of a function $f(t)$ is:
$$
F(Ï‰) = \int_{-âˆž}^{âˆž} f(t) e^{-iÏ‰t} dt
$$
The inverse transform is:
$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2Ï€} \int_{-âˆž}^{âˆž} F(Ï‰) e^{iÏ‰t} dÏ‰
$$
(DFT) is:
$$
X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i2Ï€kn/N}
$$
(IDFT) is:
$$
x_n = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k e^{i2Ï€kn/N}
$$
$N$ = num_samples
